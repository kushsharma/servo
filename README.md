 * servo delete log --dry-run --verbose
 * servo service

#### servo config *.servo* can be placed in
 * same folder as binary
 * ~/.servo

#### To generate the supported ssh private key, run the following:
```
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 4096
```
Now you have your private key. Now you need to generate the public key.

#### To generate the *public* key from your private key, run the following:
```
$ openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

Now you have a PEM format for your public key. Nice! This canâ€™t be used with SSHâ€™s authorized_keys file though, so weâ€™ll have to do one more conversion:

#### To generate the ssh-rsa public key format, run the following:
```
$ ssh-keygen -f public.pem -i -mPKCS8 > id_rsa.pub
```
